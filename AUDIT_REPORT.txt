2. ACTION TAKEN
   To resolve the "no changes visible" issue, I have performed a "Cache Busting" operation:
   - Renamed style.css -> style.v2.css
   - Renamed script.js -> script.v2.js
   - Updated index.html to link to these new files.

   This forces your browser to load the new version, as the old filenames no longer exist in the code.

3. INSTRUCTIONS
   Please refresh your browser. You should immediately see the Blue & Gold theme.
