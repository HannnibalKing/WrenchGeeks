# Catalog Audit Update V5

## Improvements Implemented
Targeted research completed for Nissan Z/G platforms and Mazda Miata (NA/NB) to fill specific technical gaps.

### 1. Nissan Z/G Platform (Z33/Z34/V35/V36)
*   **Transmission Secrets:** Added detailed identification guide for the **CD009** 6-speed manual (vs early weak versions) and the CD00A replacement.
*   **Brake Upgrades:** Documented the **Akebono Big Brake Kit** specs (14" rotors) and retrofit requirements for older chassis.
*   **Engine Hierarchy:** Clarified the critical differences between **VQ35DE**, **RevUp**, **HR**, and **VHR** engines (oil consumption issues, internal differences).
*   **Drivetrain:** Added differential ratio swap data (3.69 vs 3.36) for acceleration upgrades.

### 2. Mazda Miata (NA/NB)
*   **Weak Links:** Added critical warning for the 1.6L **"Glass Diff"** (1990-1993) and the **"Short Nose Crank"** failure points.
*   **Budget Power:** Documented the **"Exhintake"** camshaft modification (using an exhaust cam on the intake side).
*   **Interchange:** Clarified Torsen LSD availability and upgrade paths from 1.6L to 1.8L drivetrains.

### 3. Current Status
*   **Knowledge Base:** `kb_tips.json` now contains high-level technical data for these platforms, moving beyond basic interchange into "tuner knowledge".
