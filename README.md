# WrenchGeeks 🔧🤓
**The Open Source Car Part Compatibility Database**

WrenchGeeks is a community-driven database dedicated to finding interchangeable car parts, identifying cross-brand platform mates, and cataloging 3D printable solutions for enthusiast vehicles.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Smart Compatibility Engine**: Automatically links vehicles based on shared Platforms (chassis) and Engines.
*   **Cross-Brand Interchange**: Discover "Badge Engineering" secrets (e.g., Jaguar X-Type parts on a Ford Mondeo, or Toyota Supra parts on a BMW Z4).
*   **3D Printing Library**: Integrated search for community-verified 3D printable parts (e.g., E30 Odometer Gears, Miata Visor Deletes).
*   **Quick Build Selector**: One-click filters for popular enthusiast niches (Safari 911, Exocet, K-Swap, etc.).
*   **Risk Assessment**: Parts are graded by difficulty (OEM Bolt-On, Fabrication Required, Expert Only).
