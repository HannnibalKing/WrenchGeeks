    "notes": "A fuse is a deliberate weak point. If a 10A fuse blows, it means more than 10 Amps flowed through it. This is usually caused by a 'Short to Ground' (power wire touching metal). Putting a bigger fuse just allows more current to flow into the short, turning your wiring harness into a heater.",

The meter shows how much voltage is 'lost' in the wire. Ideally, it should be < 0.5 Volts. If you see 2V+, you have a corroded wire or switch.",
