    "content": "Identifying GM Gen 3/4 LS-based engines in the junkyard.\n\n*   **Iron Block (Trucks):** Found in Silverado, Sierra, Tahoe, Yukon. Codes: LQ4 (6.0L), LQ9 (6.0L HO), LM7 (5.3L), LR4 (4.8L). Heavy (~200lbs+ block weight) but virtually indestructible. Great for budget turbo builds.\n*   **Aluminum Block (Cars & Some Trucks):** Found in Corvette, Camaro, GTO, Trailblazer SS, and some pickups (L33). Codes: LS1, LS2, LS3, L33. ~80-100lbs lighter than iron. Preferred for handling/track builds.",

    "content": "The 4.8L (LR4) and 5.3L (LM7) truck engines look identical externally. The block casting numbers (e.g., '4.8/5.3') don't tell you which one it is.\n\n**How to tell:**\n1.  **VIN Code:** Check the 8th digit of the VIN. (e.g., 'V' is often 4.8L, 'T' is 5.3L - verify specific year codes).\n2.  **Piston Shape:** Pull a spark plug and inspect the piston top with a borescope or screwdriver.\n    *   **4.8L:** Flat top pistons.\n    *   **5.3L:** Dished pistons (most common Gen 3 LM7).\n    *   *Exception:* The L33 (Aluminum 5.3L) and some Gen 4 5.3s have flat tops.",

Good for budget builds.\n    *   **243 / 799:** Found on LS6 (Corvette Z06) and LS2 (Trucks/Cars). The best factory cathedral heads. D-shaped exhaust ports, larger valves, better flow.\n*   **Rectangle Port (Gen 4):** Wide, rectangular ports. Massive flow, best for high RPM/displacement.\n    *   **821:** LS3 heads (Corvette/Camaro). Hollow stem valves (lightweight).\n    *   **823:** L92 Truck heads (6.2L). Solid valves. Almost identical flow to 821.",

Flows significantly better than the standard truck intake and close to aftermarket units. Still tall.\n*   **Car Intakes (LS1/LS6/LS2/LS3):** Low profile. Required for most car swaps.

Alternator mounts low driver side (often interferes with frame rails/steering boxes in swaps).\n3.  **Corvette (Y-Body) / CTS-V:** Shallowest spacing (tightest to engine). Alternator mounts high driver side. Best for swaps with limited radiator clearance (e.g., Miata, S2000).",
