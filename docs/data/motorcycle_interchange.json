Requires the GSX-R forks, triple clamps, wheel, rotors, and calipers. Steering bearings usually need a conversion race.",

CV carburetors (Keihin CV40) are shared and are a great upgrade for older 'Butterfly' carb Harleys. 39mm front forks are common on Sportsters and older Dynas, allowing for easy front-end swaps.",
