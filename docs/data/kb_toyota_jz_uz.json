    "content": "The JZ engine family is legendary, but the differences between the Turbo (GTE) and Non-Turbo (GE) variants are critical for builders.\n\n**2JZ-GTE (Turbo):**\n*   Factory Twin Turbo.\n*   Oil Squirters: Yes (under piston cooling).\n*   Head Gasket: Multi-layer steel (MLS), lower compression (~8.5:1).\n\n**2JZ-GE (Non-Turbo):**\n*   High Compression (~10:1).\n*   Oil Squirters: No (usually).\n*   **'Na-T' Conversion:** To turbocharge a GE reliably, you typically need a thicker head gasket (to lower compression) and must drill/tap the block or use a sandwich plate for turbo oil feed. The stock GE pistons are weaker than GTE pistons but can handle ~350-400whp reliably. With GTE rods/pistons, the GE block is just as strong.",

Requires an adapter plate (e.g., Collins, Fisch) and flywheel spacer to fit JZ or UZ engines. The sheer size of the CD009 bellhousing often requires transmission tunnel hammering.",
