    "notes": "The 'ugly' truck intake manifold actually flows incredibly well (better than the LS1 car intake) and makes great torque. It fits under the hood of many older muscle cars (Chevelle, Nova, C10) but is too tall for 4th Gen Camaros or Corvettes. The cheapest way to make power on an LS swap.",
