    "content": "The 1990-1993 Miata (1.6L) came with a 6-inch rear differential that is notoriously weak. It WILL break with stock power if launched hard, and definitely with any turbo. \n*   **The Fix:** Swap in the entire rear end (diff, axles, driveshaft) from a 1.8L (1994-2005) Miata. The 1.8L diff (7-inch) is bulletproof up to ~350hp.",

    "content": "On 1999-2000 (NB1) and some other BP engines, you can take the exhaust camshaft and install it on the intake side. \n*   **Why:** The exhaust cam has more duration/lift than the stock intake cam. \n*   **Result:** Cheap horsepower (~6-10whp) for the cost of a junkyard cam and a new gear. Requires drilling the cam gear for proper timing.",

The crank pulley bolt can loosen, destroying the keyway and the crankshaft tip. \n*   **ID:** Look at the crank pulley. 4 slots = Short Nose (Risk). 8 slots = Long Nose (Safe). \n*   **Fix:** Check torque frequently or perform the 'Loctite Fix' if wobble starts.",
