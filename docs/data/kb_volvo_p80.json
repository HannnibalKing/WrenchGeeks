    "content": "The '6750' is a typo for the legendary Volvo 850 T-5R (1995) and 850 R (1996-1997). These P80 platform cars are the holy grail of 90s Volvo performance. The T-5R was a limited run (Yellow/Black/Green) with a 15G turbo. The 850 R followed with mass production. Note: Euro Manual 850 Rs got the bigger 16T turbo and LSD (M59 transmission), while US/Auto versions kept the 15G.",

It flows significantly better than the stock 850 manifold and is a direct bolt-on to the 5-cylinder head. Look for it on P2 chassis R models in the junkyard.",
