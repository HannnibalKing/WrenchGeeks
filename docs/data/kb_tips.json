Prone to synchro grinding (especially 3rd gear). Avoid for high power.\n*   **CD009 (2005-2006):** Found in 'RevUp' engine models and late DEs. Features triple-cone synchros on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and double-cone on 4th. The case usually has 'CD009' stamped or cast near the shifter, but not always. The surest sign is the VIN year or a physical inspection of the synchros.\n*   **CD00A:** The current service replacement part from Nissan. It is functionally identical to the CD009 but with minor casting updates.\n\n**Swap Notes:** The CD009 bellhousing bolt pattern fits all VQ35DE, VQ35HR, and VQ37VHR engines, but the starter location and clutch slave cylinder setup differ between DE (external slave) and HR/VHR (internal CSC).",

Significantly stronger. Can handle 250+ whp reliably. \n\n**Upgrade Path:** If you have a 1.6L NA, the best upgrade is to swap the entire rear subframe, driveshaft, and axles from a 1.8L car. The Torsen LSD found in 1994+ 'R' package and some 'M' editions is the holy grail for street/track builds.",

By sourcing a second exhaust cam and installing it in the intake position, you gain duration (typically ~251° vs stock ~240°) and lift.\n\n**The Catch:** You cannot just bolt it in. You must either:\n1.  Drill a new dowel pin hole in the cam gear to correct the timing.\n2.  Use an adjustable cam gear to dial out the phase difference.\n\n**Result:** A cheap 6-10whp gain at the top end, often for the cost of a junkyard camshaft.",

    "content": "Early 1.6L Miatas (1990-early 1991) have a crankshaft with a shorter 'nose' (keyway area) for the crank pulley bolt. \n\n**The Issue:** If the crank bolt is not torqued perfectly (or if it loosens over time), the keyway will wallow out, causing the crank pulley to wobble. This eventually destroys the crankshaft tip, requiring an engine replacement or a risky 'Loctite fix'.\n\n**Identification:** Check the crank pulley. If it has 4 slots, it's likely a Short Nose. If it has 8 slots, it's the updated Long Nose (safer). VIN cutoff is roughly ending in 209447.",
