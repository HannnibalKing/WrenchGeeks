    "content": "The CD009 (6-speed manual) is legendary for holding 1000+ hp, but not all Z33 transmissions are CD009s. \n\n*   **CD001-CD008 (2003-2004):** Weak synchros (especially 3rd gear). Avoid for high power.\n*   **CD009 (2005-2006):** Triple cone synchros on 1st, 2nd, 3rd. The one you want.\n*   **CD00A (2007+ / Replacement):** The latest version, even stronger.\n*   **ID:** Look for the shifter bracket. CD009s have a specific casting mark, but the only sure way is the VIN or case stickers. 'CD0' on the case doesn't guarantee it's a 009.",

Beware of the internal oil gallery gasket failure (low oil pressure death).\n*   **VHR (370Z/G37):** 3.7L with VVEL. Complex head, great power.",
