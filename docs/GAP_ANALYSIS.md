# Vehicle Stack Gap Analysis & Research Roadmap
**Date:** December 23, 2025
**Status:** Audit Complete

## 🔍 Executive Summary
The current knowledge base covers "Cult Classics" (Volvo P80, Subaru, E46 BMW) and general categories well. However, it lacks depth on the **most popular modern tuner platforms** (Nissan Z-cars, Mazda Miata, LS Swaps, and Toyota JZ/UZ).

## 🚨 Critical Gaps (High Priority)

### 1. The "Drift Tax" Platforms (Nissan Z & G)
*   **Missing:** Nissan 350Z (Z33), 370Z (Z34), Infiniti G35/G37.
*   **Why:** These are the current "cheap" drift cars replacing the 240SX.
*   **Research Needed:**
    *   **CD009 Transmission:** The "Godzilla" of manual swaps. Which years are good (CD001 vs CD009)? Adapter kits for LS/JZ/Rotary.
    *   **Akebono Brakes:** Swapping massive 370Z/G37 Sport brakes onto older chassis.
    *   **VQ Engines:** DE (Oil burner) vs HR (High Rev) vs VHR (VVEL). Interchangeability of intakes/plenums.

### 2. The "Answer is Always Miata" (Mazda MX-5)
*   **Missing:** NA (1990-97), NB (1999-05), NC (2006-15).
*   **Why:** The most modified car in existence.
*   **Research Needed:**
    *   **1.8L Swap:** Putting a 1.8L into a 1.6L NA.
    *   **"Exhintake" Cam:** Using an exhaust cam on the intake side for cheap power.
    *   **Brake Upgrades:** 1.8L brakes on 1.6L cars, or "Sport" brakes.
    *   **RX-8 Parts:** Yellow injectors, sway bars.

### 3. The Toyota "JZ" & "UZ" Ecosystem
*   **Missing:** Deep dive into 1JZ/2JZ and 1UZ/3UZ V8s.
*   **Why:** The JZ is the most famous engine in the world; the UZ is the "Japanese LS".
*   **Research Needed:**
    *   **Aristo to GS300:** The "GTE" swap.
    *   **1UZ V8:** The "Million Mile V8". Rod differences (thick vs thin) for boost.
    *   **Transmissions:** R154 vs W58 vs CD009 adaptations.

### 4. The "Junkyard LS" Bible (GM)
*   **Missing:** Specifics on Gen 3/4 Small Block Chevy interchange.
*   **Why:** "LS Swap the World" is the #1 modification globally.
*   **Research Needed:**
    *   **Heads:** Cathedral Port (Truck/LS1) vs Rectangle Port (LS3/L92). 706 vs 243 casting numbers (the "magic" heads).
    *   **Intakes:** Truck (tall, high torque) vs Car (low, high RPM).
    *   **Accessory Drives:** Truck (stick out far) vs Corvette (tight fit).

### 5. Modern Mopar (Hemi Gen 3)
*   **Missing:** 5.7L / 6.1L / 6.4L Hemi interchange.
*   **Why:** Chargers/Challengers are now cheap enough to be project cars.
*   **Research Needed:**
    *   **"Eagle" Heads:** Putting 2009+ heads on older 5.7 blocks.
    *   **Intake Manifolds:** 6.4L truck intake (active runner) swaps.
    *   **Mercedes Transmissions:** The NAG1 (5G-Tronic) limits and upgrades.

## ⚠️ Secondary Gaps (Medium Priority)
*   **Ford Panther Platform:** Crown Vic, Grand Marquis, Town Car. (Suspension swaps, manual swaps).
*   **Saab:** Trionic engine management hacks, cross-shopping with GM Ecotec.
*   **Land Rover:** Discovery 1/2 parts on Defenders.

## ✅ Recommended Action Plan
1.  **Research & Create:** `kb_nissan_z_g.json` (Z33/Z34/G35/G37).
2.  **Research & Create:** `kb_mazda_miata.json` (NA/NB/NC).
3.  **Research & Create:** `kb_toyota_jz_uz.json` (Supra/Lexus engines).
4.  **Research & Create:** `kb_ls_junkyard_guide.json` (GM Gen 3/4 specifics).
