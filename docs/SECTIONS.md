# Car Part Sections & Coverage Plan

To ensure we capture "every part possible" from front to back, we have defined the following logical sections. This acts as our checklist for database expansion.

- [x] Internal Components (Pistons, Rods, Lifters)
- [x] Lubrication (Oil Filters, Pumps)
- [ ] Timing (Belts, Chains, Tensioners, Guides)
- [ ] Gaskets & Seals (Head gasket, Rear Main Seal, Valve Cover)
- [ ] Cylinder Heads & Valvetrain

## 2. Engine Electrical & Sensors
**File:** `data/electrical_sensors.json`
*Focus: The nervous system of the car.*
- [x] Ignition (Coils, Plugs, Modules)
- [x] Sensors (MAF, O2, Crank, Cam, Knock, Coolant Temp)
- [x] Charging & Starting (Alternator, Starter, Battery, Regulators)
- [ ] Wiring Harnesses & Connectors
- [ ] ECU / DME / Computers

## 3. Cooling & HVAC
**File:** `data/cooling_hvac.json`
*Focus: Thermal management for engine and passengers.*
- [x] Engine Cooling (Radiators, Water Pumps, Thermostats, Hoses, Expansion Tanks)
